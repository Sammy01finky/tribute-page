          <div class="column"><p>Rabbi Abraham J. Twerski (1930-2021) was a renowned American Hasidic rabbi, psychiatrist, and author. He was a prominent figure in the Orthodox Jewish community and a respected authority on mental health and spirituality.

            Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Twerski was part of the Skverer Hasidic dynasty and a descendant of the founder of the Skverer movement, Rabbi Yitzchak Twerski. He studied at the Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin and later at Marquette University, where he earned his medical degree.
            
            Twerski's unique blend of religious and medical expertise led him to become a pioneer in the field of pastoral counseling. He believed that mental health and spiritual well-being were deeply intertwined and that a comprehensive approach to healing should address both aspects.
            </p></div>

His books, including "When Do the Good Things Start?" and "The Zeide Reb Motele", offered practical advice and inspiring stories drawn from his experiences as a rabbi, psychiatrist, and community leader.

            Twerski was also a dedicated teacher and lecturer, traveling extensively to share his insights and guidance with communities worldwide. His warm, compassionate, and humorous approach made him a beloved figure, and his wisdom continues to inspire countless individuals seeking spiritual growth and mental wellness.
            
            Despite his passing in 2021, Rabbi Abraham J. Twerski's legacy endures through his writings, teachings, and the countless lives he touched. His work remains a testament to the power of integrating faith and mental health, offering a holistic path to healing and self-improvement.
